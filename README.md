Video Game Music Blitz: The Game: The Project

## IMPORTANT NOTE 
Due to the way tracks are played (in an invisible YouTube iframe), tracks are bound to break from time to time; be it from copyright strikes or videos being deleted.

Recently GilvaSunner, one of the larger channels that uploaded VGM soundtracks, [committed to deleting his channel](https://twitter.com/GilvaSunner/status/1488555303918616581) in lieu of Nintendo cracking down on unofficial uploads of music from their games. Many of the tracks in our database used their uploads and its difficult to say how many or which links will be down.

This project is currently retired and so ammendments to the database are very unlikely. Should a track be broken, all you can really do is skip, either by typing "/skip" or clicking the skip button. To tell if a track isn't working, just check the progress bar in the top left of the screen. If the bar isn't moving, the track has failed to load.

I'm considering remaking VGMB in the future, using an automated system of adding tracks instead of doing it manually like I had before. This should make the process of adding new soundtracks - and replacing broken links - a lot easier.

## What is VGMB?
VGMB is a single-player "guess the song" featuring 2000+ tracks from all of your favorite games; from The Last of Us to Mario and everything inbetween. The project was heavily inspired by [VGM Quiz (Video Game Music Quiz)](https://www.vgm-quiz.com/). While VGMQ is great, there is a lot of necessary downtime between tracks owing to the fact that the game takes place in a global lobby. VGMB mitigates this by being singleplayer.

## VGML - Video Game Music Lounge
VGML is a bodged extension to VGMB which provides a way to sit back and relax to VGM tracks. Unlike Relaxed Mode, VGML allows you to choose a series to listen to.
